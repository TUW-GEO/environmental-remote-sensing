    "**Comparing H SAF ASCAT soil moisture estimates with in-situ sensors** \n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this notebook is to demonstrate and teach a workflow for validating ASCAT H SAF soil moisture data, sampled at 6.25$\\,$km distances, using in-situ sensors strategically placed in Mozambique. Validation in this context assesses how well satellite-derived data aligns with the temporal patterns of in-situ measurements. Remember, temporal dynamics are also crucial for anomaly detection in soil moisture records, which in turn affects our ability to monitor droughts (as discussed in the previous notebook). Such validation processes help ensure the accuracy and reliability of weather data, essential for forecasting, climate research, and decision-making. By comparing different datasets, you can identify and address any inconsistencies, thereby improving the quality of meteorological records.\n",
