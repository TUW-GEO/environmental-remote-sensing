    "In this notebook we will examine the propagation of precipitation deficits, soil water deficits, and finally their lagged effect on plants. This cascading effect of drought development, or so-called convergence of evidence, is important to study in areas where rain-fed agricultural practices are of importance, such as Mozambique.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classically drought have been categorized in four classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Meteorological drought is described as the lack of precipitation and/or increased atmospheric demand (evapotranspiration)\n",
    "- Agricultural drought is also a physical phenomenon where soils become replete of moisture\n",
    "- Hydrological drought follows when ongoing drought can then cause deficits in ground and surface reservoirs\n",
    "- Socioeconomic drought impacts society through crop loss, food insecurity, shortages of fresh-water resources\n",
    "\n",
    "The first three phenomena often follow in a cascading sequence, whereas all of them can have a direct impact on society.\n",

This correlation is logical, as we expect rain to wet the soil, which in turn nourishes plant life, and vice versa. The most significant changes in these variables appear to be linked to transitions between dry and wet seasons.\n",

    "## Exploration with Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's delve deeper into the relationships among these three variables. Linear regression, specifically Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression, is a powerful tool for explanatory data analysis. OLS is a good starting point for your analysis as it is easy to interpret; the coefficients directly relate changes in the response variable to one-unit changes in the predictor variables, with the sign and magnitude reflecting the model's effects. In an OLS regression, these effects refer to the impact of the independent variables on the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the assumptions underlying OLS regression (such as linearity, independence of observations, and normality of residuals) are likely to be violated, especially in time series analysis where observations closely spaced in time are likely to be dependent on each other (autocorrelation), we can still use OLS for an ad hoc analysis of the previously observed physical relationships. Specifically, we aim to test the following relationships:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. More rain leads to healthier vegetation.\n",
    "2. Wetter soils lead to healthier vegetation.\n",
    "\n",
    "These relationships are intuitively important causal factors. To determine which best explains the dependent variable (NDVI), we will perform OLS regression using the `statsmodels` package. Note that other Python packages, like `scipy.stats`, are also available.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll utilize `statsmodels`' formula interface, which allows specifying models with formula strings and directly using `pandas.DataFrames`. This interface employs a tilde (`~`) to separate the dependent variable from the independent variables. Interactions between variables can be specified using the `*` or `:` operators, enabling easy expansion to multiple regression. It also simplifies variable transformations and polynomial terms.\n",

To study the dynamics of these cascading droughts, we should first examine the effects of precipitation and soil moisture on vegetation under normal conditions.

    "\n",
    "1. **BLUE Estimators**:\n",
    "   Ensure your models conform to the properties of BLUE estimators (Bias, Linearity, Uncorrelated errors, and Efficiency). This will provide the most reliable and unbiased estimates for your regression coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Autocorrelation**:\n",
    "   Autocorrelation can significantly affect the reliability of your model. We've already identified strong autocorrelation in the temporal domain using autocorrelation tests. Consider looking into Generalized Least Squares models, which can account for dependency structures in their residuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Multiple Independent Variables**:\n",
    "   Incorporate multiple independent variables, including both lagged and unlagged versions. For example, include precipitation, soil moisture, and other relevant factors with appropriate lag structures to capture their delayed effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Non-normal Residuals**:\n",
    "   If your residuals are not normally distributed, it can impact the validity of your hypothesis tests. Techniques such as transforming the dependent variable (e.g., using log or Box-Cox transformations), or using robust regression methods can help address this.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Non-linear Behavior**:\n",
    "   If you detect non-linear relationships, consider using polynomial regression or non-linear regression models. Interaction terms between your independent variables can also capture non-linear effects within an OLS framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Model Diagnostics**:\n",
    "   Regularly perform diagnostic checks on your models. Examine plots of residuals versus fitted values, histograms of residuals, and autocorrelation plots to ensure model assumptions are met and identify areas for improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "By adopting these strategies, you will significantly enhance the robustness of your lagged variable OLS analysis, ensuring it is both methodologically sound and practically useful for understanding and predicting complex dynamic systems. Ultimately, this will help us better comprehend the normal wet/dry dynamics of the system, allowing us to predict the effects of current drought conditions on crops and subsequently help forecast yield."
