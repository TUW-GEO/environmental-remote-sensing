    "## What is the Soil Water Index?\n",
    "\n",
    "We have not yet talked about what the data exactly represents. The Soil Water Index is derived from surface soil moisture. The current dataset is derived from H SAF ASCAT 12.5 km and represents modelled approximation of soil water content at deeper layers of the soil. In the above plot we selected moisture content at a 10 cm depth interval. Remember that ASCAT can only probe the surface of soils.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Soil Water Index provides a measure of how wet or dry the soil is over a specific area, ranging between 0 and 1. It is often derived using a combination of satellite data and modeling techniques. One commonly used approach to derive the SWI is through the TU Wien model[^1]\n",
    "\n",
    "The equation to derive the SWI typically involves a convolution of surface soil moisture observations with an exponential filter. This process helps in estimating the root-zone soil moisture, which is more relevant for agricultural and hydrological applications. The general form of the equation can be described as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ SWI = \\frac{\\sum_{i=0}^{n} w_i \\cdot SSM_i}{\\sum_{i=0}^{n} w_i} \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\( SWI \\) is the Soil Water Index.\n",
    "- \\( SSM_i \\) represents the surface soil moisture at time step \\( i \\).\n",
    "- \\( w_i \\) is the weight assigned to the surface soil moisture at time step \\( i \\).\n",
    "- \\( n \\) is the number of time steps considered in the convolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The weights \\( w_i \\) are often determined using an exponential decay function, which gives more importance to recent observations. The exponential decay function can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ w_i = e^{-\\frac{t_i}{T}} \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\( t_i \\) is the time difference between the current time step and the time step \\( i \\).\n",
    "- \\( T \\) is a characteristic time scale that determines the rate of decay of the weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach allows the SWI to reflect the cumulative effect of surface soil moisture over a period, providing a more stable and representative measure of the soil moisture conditions in the root zone.\n",
    "\n",
    "One will observe that the SWI at depth is often less variable (more stable) than contemporaneous surface soil moisture - with only delayed and dampened responses to external forcing (e.g. precipitation). We can visualize this by applying the SWI algorithm to one of the five timeseries introduced in notebook 1.\n",
