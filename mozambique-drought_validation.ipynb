    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook continues the evaluation of drought indicators introduced in notebook 1. The H SAF ASCAT sensors onboard the MetOp series of polar-orbiting satellites supply near real-time surface soil moisture (SSM) estimates, with data extending back to 2007. This extensive record allows us to compute temporal anomalies from the SSM data, using the long-term mean as a baseline. These anomalies are then standardized as deviations, or Z scores. \n",
    "\n",
    "As noted in notebook 1, ASCAT SSM is measured in degrees of saturation, making spatial patterns reliant on soil characteristics such as porosity. However, the relative changes used for drought anomaly detection with Z scores can provide insights into spatial patterns of drought conditions without requiring auxiliary soil data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will leverage this feature to compare the H SAF ASCAT SSM-based drought indicators with other drought indicators, notably the [Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index](https://climatedataguide.ucar.edu/climate-data/standardized-precipitation-evapotranspiration-index-spei)[^1].\n",

    "## Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index\n",
    "\n",
    "Historically, many studies on drought monitoring have used hydro-meteorological indicators such as the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and the more comprehensive Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). SPEI is seen as the more robust metric for drought monitoring as it uses the difference between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration ($P – ETo$), rather than precipitation ($P$) as an input alone, and, where the potential evapotranspiration can be calculated from weather data. However, satellite-based soil moisture estimates and linked drought anomaly indices might be more suitable for agricultural drought monitoring as they focus more directly on plant water requirements by directly measuring the soil's water content.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite this, SPEI indirectly accounts for soil water conditions (but also vegetation, physiological mechanisms and climate) by combining both precipitation and potential evapotranspiration, which measures the atmospheric demand for water. Both SPEI and standardized soil moisture drought anomalies, such as Z scores, allow for direct comparisons across different regions and time scales.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize:\n",
    "\n",
    "- SPEI is a hydro-meteorological indicator for drought monitoring and thus indirectly measures soil moisture\n",
    "- Z scores are based on standardized anomalies derived from spaceborne microwave-retrieved surface soil moisture\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to compare both drought indicators, particularly focusing on the spatial extent of drought-affected areas. We will relate these indicators to recorded drought events in Mozambique between 2007 and 2021 ([The International Disaster Database](https://www.emdat.be/)).\n",

    "## Simplifying Drought Severity with Data Binning\n",
    "\n",
    "We will convert the numeric data of the drought indicators `\"spei\"` and `\"zscore\"` into discrete categories using the pandas `cut` method. In pandas, binning data—also known as discretization or quantization—involves dividing continuous numerical data into discrete bins or intervals. This process is beneficial for simplifying data, managing outliers, creating histograms, and preparing data for machine learning algorithms that require categorical input. Additionally, we will label the binned data, thereby transforming the columns into pandas categorical data types. Pandas categorical data types are used to represent data that takes on a limited and usually fixed number of possible values (categories or classes). This type is particularly useful for categorical variables such as gender, days of the week, or survey responses. It offers efficient storage and operations for categorical data, including handling category ordering and missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of binning and labeling drought data based on intensity is somewhat subjective, as the bin thresholds are often arbitrarily assigned and subject to debate. Here, we adhere to the guidelines provided by the World Meteorological Organization and the definitions by McKee et al. (1993)[^2] for standardized Soil Moisture (SM) based drought indices, where a \"moderate\" drought is defined as starting at -1 unit of standard deviations.\n",
